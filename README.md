# OCR-with-CRNN-CTC
For this task, I'm going to implement a Connectionist temporal classification(CTC) based convolutional recurrent neural netowrk(CRNN) ocr model that transcripts english handwritten images to strings.

Steps:
1. Build a data pipeline
2. Implement an image encoder (most likely a convolutional neural network encoder)
3. Build a decoder (most likely a recurrent neural network based decoder)
4. Implement the training function to train the model
5. Implement the validation function to validate the trained model
